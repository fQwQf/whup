Specifically:

- If a file contains part of this software's code, that file must be distributed under the original licensing terms.
- If a file does not contain any code from this software, the licensing terms can be freely chosen by the project maintainer, or it may be closed source.

Furthermore, users who create online services based on this software are not required to open source those services under the same agreement.

**3. License Change Clause**

The developer has the right to change the open-source license for this software to any other license or to close it. The modified license will apply to all subsequent versions of the software but will not affect the licensing conditions of versions released prior to the modification.

This agreement is governed by the laws of the developer's country/region. If any legal issues arise within this legal framework, the developer reserves the final interpretation rights.

**5. Patent License Limitations**

This agreement explicitly does not grant any patent rights related to this software unless the user obtains additional written authorization. Users must assume the risk of patent disputes arising from their use.

**11. Multilingual Versions**

This agreement is available in multiple languages. **We strive to keep the versions consistent across languages; however, in exceptional cases where conflicts arise, the language version actually used shall take precedence.** If multiple language versions of the license files exist within a project, they should be sorted by **file size in ascending order**, with the **first language version** in the first file being the valid version.
